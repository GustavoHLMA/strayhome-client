# Strayhome-Web 🐶🐱

## Description ℹ️

Strayhome is a platform on the Hedera network that enables users to create and participate in crowdfunding campaigns dedicated to helping pets. Each campaign is powered by smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency. Beyond crowdfunding, PetCompanion offers a playful way to engage in pet adoption. Users can create pet profiles that function like social media, making the adoption process fun and interactive. These profiles can also promote unrelated campaigns, encouraging donations through the charm and stories of each pet. Strayhome combines Hedera's technology with a unique user experience to support and adopt pets securely.
